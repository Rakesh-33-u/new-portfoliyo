        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline for classifying DNA sequences into their respective biological categoriesâ€”such as species, gene functions, or disease associations. With the increasing volume of genomic data being generated
            by next-generation sequencing technologies, there is a growing need for automated, accurate, and scalable approaches to interpret DNA sequences. Traditional bioinformatics methods, while effective, are often rule-based and require domain expertise.
            In contrast, machine learning offers a data-driven alternative that can discover complex patterns in biological data with minimal manual intervention..</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>DNA sequences are converted into 3-mers (overlapping substrings of length 3).</li>
            <li>Text vectorization (like Bag-of-Words) is used.</li>
            <li>Random Forest classifier is trained and tested.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We use accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate the model.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this project, we successfully demonstrated how machine learning techniques can be applied to the classification of DNA sequences. By converting DNA sequences into numerical or k-mer-based features and feeding them into various classifiers like
            Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks, we achieved promising classification accuracy. The use of feature extraction techniques, such as one-hot encoding or k-mer frequency vectors, proved essential in bridging the gap
            between biological sequences and computational models..</p>
